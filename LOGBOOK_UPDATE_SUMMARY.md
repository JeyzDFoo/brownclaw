# Logbook Update Summary

## Changes Made

The logbook section of the app has been significantly enhanced with the following improvements:

### üóìÔ∏è **Run Date Selection**
- Added a date picker that allows users to select the actual date they ran the river
- Displays the date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Defaults to today's date but can be changed to any past date

### üîç **Smart River and Run Search**
- **River Search**: Users can now search for rivers from the database instead of typing manually
  - Displays river name, region, and country
  - Auto-complete functionality with search-as-you-type
  - Compact search results dropdown (max 120px height)

- **Run/Section Search**: Once a river is selected, users can search for specific runs/sections
  - Only shows runs for the selected river
  - Displays run name, difficulty class, and length
  - Auto-complete with search-as-you-type

### ü§ñ **Automatic Metadata Filling**
- When a run is selected, the difficulty class is automatically filled in
- Users can still override the difficulty if conditions were different than usual
- Helper text indicates when difficulty is auto-filled

### üìä **Enhanced Data Structure**
- New logbook entries now store:
  - `riverRunId`: Reference to the actual RiverRun in the database
  - `runDate`: The actual date the user ran the river (separate from log entry date)
  - Backward compatibility maintained with existing entries

### üé® **Improved User Interface**
- **Selection Display**: Shows currently selected river and run with visual confirmation
- **Compact Layout**: Limited search result heights to prevent UI overflow
- **Scrollable Form**: The entire form is now scrollable to handle smaller screens
- **Dense List Items**: More compact search results for better usability
- **Loading Indicators**: Shows spinning indicators while searching

### üì± **Enhanced Logbook Display**
- **Run Date**: Now shows both the actual run date and when the entry was logged
- **Better Layout**: Separated run date and log date for clarity
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with both new enhanced entries and legacy entries

## Technical Details

### New Files Created
