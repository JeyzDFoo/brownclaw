# River Descents Privacy Fix

## üî¥ Critical Security Flaw Fixed

**Date:** October 20, 2025

### The Problem

The Firestore security rules for the `river_descents` collection had a **critical privacy flaw** that allowed any authenticated user to read ALL river descents from ALL users.

#### Original Rule (INSECURE):
```javascript
match /river_descents/{descentId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated()
    && (isOwner(resource.data.userId) || request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId);
  
  allow update: if isAuthenticated()
    && isOwner(resource.data.userId)
    && request.resource.data.userId == resource.data.userId;
  
  allow delete: if isAuthenticated()
    && isOwner(resource.data.userId);
}
```

**Why it was insecure:**
- The read condition `(isOwner(resource.data.userId) || request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId)` was redundant
- `isOwner(resource.data.userId)` internally checks `request.auth.uid == userId`
- So the condition was effectively just checking `isAuthenticated()`
- This meant **ANY authenticated user could query and read ALL descents**

### The Fix

#### New Rule (SECURE):
```javascript
match /river_descents/{descentId} {
  // Users can ONLY read their own descents
  allow read: if isAuthenticated()
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  
  allow create: if isAuthenticated()
    && isValidString('riverRunId')
    && isValidString('userId')
    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
    && isValidTimestamp('timestamp');
  
  allow update: if isAuthenticated()
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId
    && request.resource.data.userId == resource.data.userId;
  
  allow delete: if isAuthenticated()
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```

**What changed:**
1. **Read access**: Now explicitly checks `request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId`
2. **Update access**: Simplified to use direct comparison instead of the `isOwner()` helper
3. **Delete access**: Simplified to use direct comparison instead of the `isOwner()` helper
4. **Added comment**: Clarifies that river descents are PRIVATE user-owned data

### Security Impact

#### Before:
- ‚ùå Any user could query: `.collection('river_descents').get()` and see ALL descents
- ‚ùå Any user could see other users' logbook entries
- ‚ùå Privacy violation

#### After:
- ‚úÖ Users can ONLY read their own descents
- ‚úÖ Queries like `.where('userId', '==', user.uid)` work correctly
- ‚úÖ Queries without proper userId filtering are denied by Firestore
- ‚úÖ Complete privacy protection

### Application Code

The application code was **already correctly filtering** by userId:

```dart
// logbook_screen.dart
stream: _firestore
  .collection('river_descents')
  .where('userId', isEqualTo: user.uid)  // ‚úÖ Correct
  .orderBy('timestamp', descending: true)
  .snapshots()

// user_runs_history_widget.dart
stream: FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('river_descents')
  .where('userId', isEqualTo: user.uid)      // ‚úÖ Correct
  .where('riverRunId', isEqualTo: riverRunId)
  .orderBy('timestamp', descending: true)
  .snapshots()
```

**No application code changes were needed** - only the security rules were updated.

### Deployment

The fixed rules were deployed on October 20, 2025:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

Status: ‚úÖ **Deployed successfully**

### Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Test as User A:**
   - Create a river descent entry
   - Verify you can see it in your logbook

2. **Test as User B:**
   - Try to query all descents (should fail or return empty)
   - Try to read User A's descent by ID (should fail)
   - Create your own descent
   - Verify you ONLY see your own descents

3. **Test in Firebase Console:**
   - Try to read a descent document directly
   - Should only work if the logged-in user matches the document's userId

### Related Collections

Other collections are properly secured:

| Collection | Access Control | Status |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| `rivers` | Public read, authenticated write | ‚úÖ Correct (shared data) |
| `river_runs` | Public read, authenticated write | ‚úÖ Correct (shared data) |
| `river_descents` | **Private per user** | ‚úÖ **FIXED** |
| `user_favorites` | Private per user | ‚úÖ Correct |
| `users` | Private per user | ‚úÖ Correct |
| `water_stations` | Public read, backend write | ‚úÖ Correct |
| `gauge_stations` | Public read, backend write | ‚úÖ Correct |

### Key Takeaway

**River Descents are personal logbook entries and should NEVER be visible to other users.**

The fix ensures complete privacy while maintaining all existing functionality in the app.
