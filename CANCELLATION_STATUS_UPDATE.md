# Subscription Cancellation Status Display

## Overview
Updated the app to properly display subscription cancellation status when users cancel their subscription but still have active premium access until the billing period ends.

## Implementation Date
October 18, 2025

## Problem
After cancelling a subscription, users would still see the "Cancel Subscription" button, which was confusing since the subscription was already cancelled (but still active until period end).

## Solution
Track and display the `cancel_at_period_end` status from Stripe to show appropriate UI based on subscription state.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Updates (`functions/main.py`)

#### `cancelSubscription` Function
- Now saves `cancelAtPeriodEnd` and `currentPeriodEnd` to Firestore
- Returns the period end date to the client

```python
user_ref.set({
    'subscriptionStatus': subscription.status,
    'cancelAtPeriodEnd': subscription.cancel_at_period_end,
    'currentPeriodEnd': subscription.current_period_end
}, merge=True)
```

#### `getSubscriptionStatus` Function
- Now returns `cancelAtPeriodEnd` and `currentPeriodEnd` fields
- Syncs this data to Firestore for offline access

### 2. Provider Updates (`lib/providers/premium_provider.dart`)

Added new fields to track cancellation status:
- `bool _cancelAtPeriodEnd` - Whether subscription is set to cancel
- `DateTime? _currentPeriodEnd` - When the current billing period ends
- Getters for both fields

Parses Firestore data to populate these fields from stored subscription info.

### 3. UI Updates (`lib/screens/premium_settings_screen.dart`)

#### Dynamic Message Display
- **Active subscription**: "Need to cancel? Your premium features will remain active until the end of your current billing period."
- **Cancelled subscription**: "Your subscription has been cancelled and will end on [DATE]. You can resubscribe at any time."

#### Conditional Button Display
Three states:
1. **Active Premium (not cancelled)**: Shows red "Cancel Subscription" button
2. **Cancelled Premium (still active)**: Shows orange info box "Cancellation scheduled"
3. **No Premium**: Shows amber "Subscribe to Premium" button

#### Helper Method
Added `_formatDate()` to display dates in friendly format (e.g., "Dec 31, 2025")

## User Experience States

### State 1: Active Subscription
```
Manage Subscription
Need to cancel? Your premium features will remain active 
until the end of your current billing period.
[Cancel Subscription] (red button)
```

### State 2: Cancelled (Still Active)
```
Manage Subscription
Your subscription has been cancelled and will end on Jan 15, 2026.
You can resubscribe at any time.
ℹ️ Cancellation scheduled (orange info box)
```

### State 3: No Premium
```
Get Premium
Unlock extended historical data and advanced features with Premium.
[Subscribe to Premium] (amber button)
```

## Data Flow

1. User clicks "Cancel Subscription"
2. `cancelSubscription` Cloud Function called
3. Stripe sets `cancel_at_period_end=True`
4. Firestore updated with cancellation status
5. `PremiumProvider` refreshes and loads new data
6. UI automatically updates to show "Cancellation scheduled"
7. When period ends, Stripe webhook fires `customer.subscription.deleted`
8. `isPremium` set to `false`, user loses access

## Benefits

✅ **Clear communication** - Users know exactly when their access ends
✅ **No confusion** - Cancel button hidden after cancellation
✅ **Visual feedback** - Orange info box clearly indicates scheduled cancellation
✅ **Resubscription path** - Message reminds users they can resubscribe
✅ **Accurate dates** - Shows exact end date from Stripe

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Deploy backend functions
- [ ] Test cancellation flow in app
- [ ] Verify "Cancellation scheduled" appears after cancel
- [ ] Check date formatting is correct
- [ ] Confirm cancel button doesn't reappear
- [ ] Test that premium features still work until period end
- [ ] Verify status updates when period actually ends
- [ ] Test resubscription flow after cancellation

## Technical Notes

- Period end timestamp comes from Stripe as Unix timestamp (seconds)
- Converted to DateTime for display
- Falls back to generic message if date unavailable
- Status synced to Firestore for offline reliability
