# River Name Auto-Suggest Feature

## Summary
Added auto-suggest functionality for river names when creating a new logbook entry **and when creating a new river run**. As users type in the river name field, the app now suggests existing rivers from the database that match their input.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `logbook_entry_screen.dart`

#### Replaced Components:
- **Old**: Simple `TextFormField` with manual search results dropdown
- **New**: Flutter's `Autocomplete` widget with intelligent suggestions

#### Key Improvements:

1. **Better UX**: 
   - Users see suggestions as they type (minimum 1 character)
   - Suggestions appear in a clean dropdown below the field
   - Shows river name with region and country information
   - Visual feedback with a green checkmark when a river is selected

2. **Smart Filtering**:
   - Queries the database in real-time as users type
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Partial matches supported (e.g., typing "kick" will find "Kicking Horse River")

3. **State Management**:
   - Clears run selection if user changes the river name (logbook entry)
   - Auto-fills region and country when selecting an existing river (create run)
   - Syncs the autocomplete controller with the existing river search controller
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

### 2. Updated `create_river_run_screen.dart`

#### Replaced Components:
- **Old**: Simple `TextFormField` for river name entry
- **New**: Flutter's `Autocomplete` widget with intelligent suggestions

#### Key Improvements:

1. **Smart Pre-filling**:
   - When user selects an existing river, region and country are automatically filled
   - Gauge stations reload automatically for the selected river
   - Reduces data entry time significantly

2. **Better UX**:
   - Same consistent autocomplete experience as logbook entry
   - Green checkmark appears when an existing river is selected
   - Helpful hint: "Start typing to see suggestions..."

3. **Prevent Duplicates**:
   - Users can easily see if a river already exists
   - Encourages reuse of existing river records
   - Maintains database integrity

### Code Structure

```dart
// New helper method to fetch suggestions
Future<List<River>> _getSuggestedRivers(String query) async {
  if (query.isEmpty) return [];
  
  try {
    final results = await RiverService.searchRivers(query).first;
    return results;
  } catch (e) {
    return [];
  }
}

// Autocomplete widget implementation
Autocomplete<River>(
  optionsBuilder: (TextEditingValue textEditingValue) async {
    if (textEditingValue.text.isEmpty) {
      return const Iterable<River>.empty();
    }
    return await _getSuggestedRivers(textEditingValue.text);
  },
  displayStringForOption: (River river) => river.name,
  onSelected: (River river) {
    _selectRiver(river);
  },
  // Custom field view builder for styling
  fieldViewBuilder: (...) { ... },
  // Custom options view builder for dropdown styling
  optionsViewBuilder: (...) { ... },
)
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User starts typing**: e.g., "Kick"
2. **System queries database**: Searches for rivers matching "Kick"
3. **Suggestions appear**: Shows "Kicking Horse River - British Columbia, Canada"
4. **User selects**: Taps on the suggestion
5. **Selection confirmed**: Green checkmark appears, runs are loaded for that river

## Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ **Faster entry**: No need to type full river names
- ✅ **Consistency**: Ensures correct river names from database
- ✅ **Discovery**: See what rivers are already in the system
- ✅ **Error prevention**: Reduces typos and duplicate entries
- ✅ **Better mobile UX**: Easier on smaller screens

### For Data Quality:
- ✅ **Standardization**: River names stay consistent
- ✅ **Reduced duplicates**: Less chance of creating duplicate rivers
- ✅ **Database integrity**: Links to existing river records

## Technical Details

### Dependencies:
- Uses Flutter's built-in `Autocomplete` widget (no additional packages)
- Leverages existing `RiverService.searchRivers()` method
- Maintains compatibility with existing state management

### Performance:
- Queries run asynchronously to avoid blocking UI
- Returns empty list for empty queries (no unnecessary database calls)
- Reuses existing search infrastructure

### Styling:
- Dropdown constrained to 200px height (scrollable)
- Max width of 400px for better desktop experience
- Material elevation for visual hierarchy
- Consistent with app's design language

## Testing Recommendations

To manually test the feature:

1. Open the app and navigate to Logbook
2. Tap the "+" button to create a new entry
3. Start typing in the River Name field
4. Verify suggestions appear as you type
5. Select a river from the suggestions
6. Verify the green checkmark appears
7. Verify runs for that river are loaded
8. Try changing the text after selection
9. Verify selection clears and runs are reset

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Fuzzy matching**: Better handling of typos and variations
2. **Recent rivers**: Show user's recently logged rivers first
3. **Popular rivers**: Surface frequently logged rivers
4. **Location-based**: Prioritize rivers near user's location
5. **Offline support**: Cache river list for offline use
6. **Custom sorting**: Sort by distance, popularity, or alphabetically

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing entries continue to work
- ✅ Edit mode still functions correctly
- ✅ Prefilled runs (from favorites) still work
- ✅ All existing state management preserved

## Files Modified

- `lib/screens/logbook_entry_screen.dart` - Auto-suggest for logbook entries
- `lib/screens/create_river_run_screen.dart` - Auto-suggest for creating runs
