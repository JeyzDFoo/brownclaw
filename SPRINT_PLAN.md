2. **Service-Level Caching** - Biggest performance win
3. **Batch Firestore Queries** - Critical for favorites screen

### Should Have (Sprints 2-3)
4. **Type Safety** - Improves maintainability
5. **LiveWaterData Adoption** - Reduces bugs
6. **RiverLevelsScreen Refactor** - Cleans architecture

### Nice to Have (Sprints 4-5)
7. **Production Features** - Firebase monitoring
8. **UI Polish** - Mobile-first design
9. **Build Configuration** - Release readiness

---

## üöß Implementation Notes

### High-Risk Changes
- **RiverLevelsScreen refactor** (marked as MAJOR) - needs careful planning
- **LiveWaterData migration** - touches many files
- **Batch query implementation** - changes data flow

### Quick Wins
- Debug UI removal (2 TODOs, 5 minutes)
- Width constraint removal (1 TODO, 5 minutes)
- Optimistic updates (improves perceived performance)

### Dependencies Between Tasks
1. CacheProvider must be implemented first
2. Type models should be adopted before major refactors
3. Service caching before provider caching
4. Architecture refactor before production features

---

## üìù Additional Observations

### Code Duplication Issues
Multiple files have duplicate `_safeToDouble()` helper:
- `lib/models/river_station.dart`
- `lib/models/gauge_station.dart`
- `lib/models/river_run.dart`
- `lib/models/river_descent.dart`
- `lib/models/live_water_data.dart`
- `lib/services/favorite_rivers_service.dart`

**Recommendation:** Create shared utility in `lib/utils/type_converters.dart`

### Generated Code (Not TODOs)
These are Flutter/Gradle generated and can be ignored:
- `windows/flutter/CMakeLists.txt` - Flutter framework TODO
- Various `toDouble()` calls - normal Dart conversion

---

## üé¨ Getting Started

### Week 1 (Sprint 1) - Recommended First Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Create `lib/utils/type_converters.dart` with shared helpers
2. ‚úÖ Implement core `CacheProvider` methods
3. ‚úÖ Add caching to `GaugeStationService` (smallest service)
4. ‚úÖ Test and validate caching works
5. ‚úÖ Roll out to other services

### Validation at Each Step:
- Run existing tests: `flutter test`
- Check performance with Flutter DevTools
- Measure Firestore reads in Firebase Console
- Profile app launch time
