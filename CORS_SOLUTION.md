# CORS Issue Resolution - Canadian Water Office API

## Problem
The Canadian Water Office API (`https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/`) was returning `ClientException: Failed to fetch` errors when called from a web browser. This is due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

## Root Cause
- Government APIs often don't include CORS headers for security reasons
- Web browsers block requests to external domains without proper CORS configuration
- The Environment Canada Water Office API doesn't allow direct browser access

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Platform Detection
```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

if (kIsWeb) {
  // Use mock data for web platform
  return _getWebMockData();
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Mock Data
- Created realistic demo data for 10 Canadian whitewater rivers
- Includes all required fields for UI compatibility
- Time-stamped data to show when it was generated
- Clearly labeled as "Demo Data"

### 3. User Communication
- Added info banner explaining CORS limitations
- Informed users that real-time data is available on mobile
- Made it clear when demo data is being displayed

## Alternative Solutions (for future consideration)

### 1. Proxy Server
- Create a backend service to proxy requests
- Backend makes the API calls (no CORS restrictions)
- Frontend calls your backend

### 2. Mobile-Only Real Data
- Keep web version as demo/promotional
- Real-time data only on mobile apps
- Web version shows static examples

### 3. Alternative APIs
- Find APIs that support CORS
- Use multiple data sources
- Implement fallback mechanisms

## Current Status
✅ Web version works with comprehensive demo data  
✅ Search and favorites functionality intact  
✅ Clear user communication about data limitations  
⚠️ Real-time data only available when CORS is not an issue (mobile platforms)

## Files Modified
- `lib/services/canadian_water_service.dart` - Added platform detection and web mock data
- `lib/screens/river_levels_screen.dart` - Added demo data info banner
