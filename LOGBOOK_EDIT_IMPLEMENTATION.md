# Logbook Edit Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Implemented proper edit functionality for logbook entries using a dedicated `LogbookProvider` to manage state across screens.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created LogbookProvider (`lib/providers/logbook_provider.dart`)

A new provider to manage logbook entry state and operations:

```dart
class LogbookProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  // State management for editing
  String? _editingEntryId;
  Map<String, dynamic>? _editingEntryData;
  
  // Methods
  - setEditingEntry(entryId, entryData)  // Set entry to edit
  - clearEditingEntry()                   // Clear editing state
  - updateEntry(entryId, data)           // Update existing entry
  - addEntry(data)                       // Add new entry  
  - deleteEntry(entryId)                 // Delete entry
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Centralized logbook data management
- Clean separation of concerns
- State persists across navigation
- Easy to test and maintain

### 2. Updated Main App (`lib/main.dart`)

Added LogbookProvider to the MultiProvider:

```dart
ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => LogbookProvider()),
```

### 3. Updated LogbookScreen (`lib/screens/logbook_screen.dart`)

Modified the edit button to use the provider:

```dart
// When edit is tapped
context.read<LogbookProvider>().setEditingEntry(doc.id, data);

// Navigate to entry screen
await Navigator.of(context).push(...);

// Clear editing state when returning
context.read<LogbookProvider>().clearEditingEntry();
```

### 4. Updated LogbookEntryScreen (`lib/screens/logbook_entry_screen.dart`)

#### Added Edit Mode Detection
- Checks `LogbookProvider.isEditMode` in initState
- Loads existing entry data if in edit mode
- Updates AppBar title: "Edit River Descent" vs "Log River Descent"

#### Data Loading
New `_loadEditingData()` method populates form fields:
- Notes text
- Rating emoji
- Run date
- Water level/discharge data
- River and run names (for display)

#### Smart Submit Logic
The submit button now:
- Detects if editing or creating
- Uses `updateEntry()` for edits (preserves timestamp)
- Uses `addEntry()` for new entries (adds timestamp)
- Shows appropriate success message

## User Flow

### Creating New Entry
1. User taps "Log Descent" FAB
2. Screen opens with empty form
3. User fills in details
4. Taps "Log Descent" button
5. Entry is added to Firestore
6. Returns to logbook with success message

### Editing Existing Entry
1. User taps menu (â‹®) on logbook card
2. Selects "Edit"
3. Provider stores entry ID and data
4. Screen opens with pre-filled form
5. AppBar shows "Edit River Descent"
6. User modifies details
7. Taps "Log Descent" button
8. Entry is updated in Firestore (preserves original timestamp)
9. Provider clears editing state
10. Returns to logbook with success message

## Technical Details

### State Management
- **Provider Pattern**: Uses ChangeNotifier for reactive updates
- **Scoped State**: Editing state is scoped to the provider, not passed through constructors
- **Clean Navigation**: State is cleared when user navigates away

### Data Preservation
- **Timestamps**: Original timestamp preserved when editing
- **User Info**: User data remains unchanged during edits
- **Water Data**: Historical water level data can be updated

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all Firestore operations
- User-friendly error messages via SnackBars
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions

## Benefits of Provider Approach

1. **Clean Architecture**: No props drilling, state lives in provider
2. **Testable**: Provider can be easily mocked for testing
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add more logbook operations
4. **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for logbook state
5. **Reusable**: Provider can be accessed from any widget in the tree

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add undo functionality after deletion
- [ ] Batch operations (edit/delete multiple entries)
- [ ] Export logbook entries
- [ ] Sync indicators for offline edits
- [ ] Optimistic updates for better UX
