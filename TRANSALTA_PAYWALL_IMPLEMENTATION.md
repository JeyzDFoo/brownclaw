# TransAlta Flow Widget Paywall Implementation

## Overview
Added premium paywall to restrict extended forecast days (beyond tomorrow) to premium users only.

## Changes Made

### Updated `lib/widgets/transalta_flow_widget.dart`

**Changes**:
1. Added `PremiumProvider` import and `PremiumPurchaseScreen` import
2. Changed from `Consumer<TransAltaProvider>` to `Consumer2<TransAltaProvider, PremiumProvider>`
3. Updated method signatures to accept `PremiumProvider`
4. Added paywall logic to filter displayed days based on premium status

## Paywall Logic

### Free Users See:
- âœ… Current flow conditions
- âœ… **Today's** flow schedule (day 0)
- âœ… **Tomorrow's** flow schedule (day 1)
- ðŸ”’ **Paywall card** for remaining days (days 2-3)

### Premium Users See:
- âœ… Current flow conditions
- âœ… **All 4 days** of forecast (days 0-3)

## Paywall Card Features

The paywall card displays when:
- User is not premium (`!premiumProvider.isPremium`)
- AND there are forecast days beyond tomorrow (`day > 1`)

**Card Design**:
- Gradient background (blue to purple)
- Lock icon
- Dynamic text: "Unlock X More Days" (1 or 2 days depending on forecast)
- Description: "See the full 4-day forecast with Premium"
- **Upgrade to Premium** button with star icon

**Button Action**:
- Navigates to `PremiumPurchaseScreen`
- Uses standard MaterialPageRoute navigation

## Code Structure

### _buildHighFlowSchedule Method
```dart
Widget _buildHighFlowSchedule(
  List<HighFlowPeriod> highFlowPeriods,
  PremiumProvider premiumProvider,
)
```

**Logic Flow**:
1. Group all periods by day number (0-3)
2. Sort days in ascending order
3. Always show days 0 and 1 (today and tomorrow)
4. Check premium status for remaining days:
   - If premium: Show all remaining days
   - If not premium: Show paywall card

### _buildPaywallCard Method
```dart
Widget _buildPaywallCard(int lockedDaysCount)
```

**Features**:
- Uses `Builder` widget to access context for navigation
- Gradient background for premium feel
- Dynamic messaging based on locked days count
- Navigation to premium purchase screen

## User Flow

### Non-Premium User:
1. Opens Kananaskis River detail page
2. Sees current flow and today/tomorrow forecasts
3. Sees attractive paywall card with upgrade CTA
4. Taps "Upgrade to Premium"
5. Navigates to premium purchase screen
6. Completes purchase
7. Returns to see full 4-day forecast

### Premium User:
1. Opens Kananaskis River detail page
2. Sees current flow and all 4 days of forecasts
3. No paywall card displayed

## Benefits

1. **Value Proposition**: Clear benefit for premium subscription
2. **Fair Access**: Basic functionality (today/tomorrow) remains free
3. **Conversion Funnel**: Easy path to upgrade with prominent CTA
4. **User Experience**: Non-intrusive paywall with clear messaging
5. **Revenue Opportunity**: Motivates upgrades for planning ahead

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Free User
- Expected: See today, tomorrow, and paywall card
- Verify: Paywall button navigates to purchase screen

### Test 2: Premium User
- Expected: See all 4 days without paywall
- Verify: No paywall card appears

### Test 3: No Flow Beyond Tomorrow
- Expected: No paywall card if only days 0-1 have flow
- Verify: Paywall only shows when days 2+ have flow data

## Integration Points

- **Favorites Screen**: Still shows today's summary (free tier)
- **River Detail Screen**: Full widget with paywall for extended forecast
- **Premium Purchase Screen**: Standard upgrade flow

## Design Considerations

### Why Today + Tomorrow Are Free:
1. **Immediate Planning**: Users can plan for next day without premium
2. **Fair Value**: Enough functionality to be useful
3. **Premium Value**: Extended planning (2-4 days ahead) is premium feature
4. **Industry Standard**: Similar to weather apps (basic now/tomorrow free, extended paid)

### Paywall Placement:
- Placed after free days, not blocking primary content
- Visually distinct with gradient and lock icon
- Clear call-to-action with upgrade button
- Non-aggressive, but visible

## Future Enhancements

1. **A/B Testing**: Test different messaging on paywall card
2. **Analytics**: Track conversion rate from paywall clicks
3. **Pricing Display**: Show price on paywall card
4. **Trial Offers**: "Try 7 days free" messaging
5. **Feature Highlights**: List more premium benefits on card

## Files Modified

- âœ… `lib/widgets/transalta_flow_widget.dart`

## Technical Notes

- Uses `Consumer2` for reactive updates from both providers
- Premium status changes immediately update the UI
- No additional API calls - just filtering display
- Maintains existing caching and state management
