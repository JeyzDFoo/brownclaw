# Weather Day Label Fix - Complete Solution

## The Problem
Both the Kananaskis weather widget and Environment Canada weather forecast widget were showing incorrect day labels like "Today, Wed, Tomorrow, Sat" because they were using stale cached weather data with old forecast dates.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurs due to multiple layers of caching:

1. **Static in-memory cache** (15-minute timeout)
2. **Persistent storage cache** (15-minute timeout) 
3. **WeatherProvider cache** (30-minute timeout)

When cached weather data is loaded, it contains `forecastTime` dates from when the data was originally fetched. The day labels were calculated from these stale dates instead of the current date.

## The Fix
Applied to both widgets:

### 1. Kananaskis Widget (`TransAltaFlowWidget`)
Two changes were implemented:

**Index-Based Day Labels:**
```dart
// OLD: Used stale cached dates
final dayName = _getDayName(day.forecastTime);

// NEW: Uses index relative to current date  
final dayName = _getDayLabelByIndex(index);
```

**Cache Date Correction:**
Added `_updateForecastDates()` method that recalculates forecast dates when loading cached data:
```dart
// Fix stale dates in cached forecast data
final updatedForecast = _updateForecastDates(forecast);
```

### 2. Environment Canada Widget (`WeatherForecastWidget`)
Applied the same index-based solution:
```dart
// OLD: Used cached forecastTime
final date = day.forecastTime ?? DateTime.now();
Text(_formatDay(date))

// NEW: Uses index-based calculation
Text(_formatDayByIndex(index))
```

## Testing the Fix

### Immediate Test
The fix should work immediately for new app sessions. To test both widgets:

**Kananaskis Rivers:**
1. **Open any Kananaskis river** (e.g., "Kananaskis River")
2. **Check TransAlta weather forecast**: Should show "Today, Fri, Sat, Sun" (or current sequence)

**Environment Canada Rivers:**  
1. **Open any non-Kananaskis river** (e.g., "Ottawa River", "Bow River")
2. **Check weather forecast section**: Should show "Today, Fri, Sat, Sun" (or current sequence)

### If Labels Still Don't Update
The cache might still be valid (within 15-30 minutes). Options:

1. **Wait 15+ minutes** for cache to expire naturally
2. **Force app restart**: Close the app completely and reopen
3. **Use debug method** (for developers):
   ```dart
   // For Kananaskis widget
   TransAltaFlowWidget.clearAllWeatherCaches();
   ```

### Verification Steps
1. **Test both river types**: Kananaskis (TransAlta) and Environment Canada rivers
2. **Check weather forecast sections** in both
3. **Day labels should be**: "Today, [Current Day Name], [Day+2], [Day+3]"
4. **Labels should update correctly** when viewed on different days

## Technical Details

### Cache Invalidation Strategy
- **Stale-while-revalidate**: Returns cached data immediately while fetching fresh data in background
- **Date correction**: Updates forecast dates in cached data to current date sequence
- **Multi-layer clearing**: Clears both static and persistent storage caches

### Debug Methods Available
```dart
// Clear all caches (forces fresh data fetch)
TransAltaFlowWidget.clearAllWeatherCaches();

// Check current cached dates
TransAltaFlowWidget.debugCachedDates();
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
Both weather widgets now show:
- **Correct day sequence**: Always shows Today, then actual day names  
- **No "Tomorrow"**: Shows actual day names (Fri, Sat, Sun, etc.)
- **Dynamic updates**: Day labels update correctly based on current date
- **Cache-independent**: Works regardless of when weather data was cached

## Affected Components
1. **Kananaskis Rivers**: `TransAltaFlowWidget` (Premium feature with flow forecasts)
2. **Environment Canada Rivers**: `WeatherForecastWidget` (Standard weather forecast)
3. **All river types**: Weather forecast day labels now display correctly

The fix ensures users always see accurate, current day labels for weather forecasts across the entire app.
