# PWA Version Control & Update Strategy

## Codebase Versioning
- Use Git for all source control and release management.
- Tag each production release (e.g., v1.0.0) for traceability.
- Update `pubspec.yaml` version for every release.

## User-Facing Versioning
- Display the app version in the UI (e.g., About or Settings screen).
- Maintain a changelog for transparency and debugging.

## Service Worker & Cache Management
- Ensure the service worker updates and clears old caches on new deployments.
- Use versioned asset URLs or cache-busting strategies to avoid stale content.

## Update Detection
- Implement logic to detect when a new version is available (e.g., via service worker events).
- Prompt users to refresh or reload when an update is detected.

## Rollback Plan
- Tag releases and keep previous builds for quick rollback if needed.
