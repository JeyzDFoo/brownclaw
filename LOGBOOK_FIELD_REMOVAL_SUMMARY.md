# Logbook Update: Remove Manual Entry Fields

## Changes Made

### ‚ùå **Removed Manual Entry Fields**

The following fields have been removed from the logbook entry form:

1. **Difficulty Class Dropdown**: 
   - Users can no longer manually select/override difficulty class
   - Difficulty now comes directly from the selected run's database data
   - This ensures consistency and accuracy

2. **Water Level Text Field**:
   - Users can no longer manually enter water level information
   - Water level data should come from live gauge station data or database
   - This prevents inconsistent manual entries

### ‚úÖ **What Now Happens**

1. **Difficulty Class**: Automatically stored from the selected RiverRun's `difficultyClass` field
2. **Water Level**: No longer collected from user input (legacy entries will still display their stored values)

### üîß **Technical Changes**

#### Removed from State:
- `_selectedDifficulty` variable
- `_waterLevelController` TextEditingController

#### Updated Methods:
- `_selectRun()`: Removed difficulty auto-filling logic
- `_addLogEntry()`: Now uses `_selectedRun!.difficultyClass` directly
- `dispose()`: Removed water level controller disposal

#### Updated UI:
- Removed difficulty class dropdown form field
- Removed water level text input field
- Simplified form layout

### üìä **Data Storage**

New logbook entries now store:
```dart
{
  'riverRunId': _selectedRun!.id,
  'riverName': _selectedRiver!.name, // Backward compatibility
  'section': _selectedRun!.name, // Backward compatibility  
  'difficulty': _selectedRun!.difficultyClass, // From database
  'notes': _notesController.text.trim(),
  // ... other fields
  // waterLevel field removed
}
```

### üîÑ **Backward Compatibility**

- Legacy entries with manually entered difficulty and water level will still display correctly
- The display logic for water level is preserved for legacy entries
- New entries will have consistent database-driven difficulty values

### üéØ **Benefits**

1. **Data Consistency**: Difficulty class comes directly from curated database
2. **Reduced User Error**: No manual entry means no typos or inconsistent values
3. **Simplified UX**: Fewer fields to fill out makes logging faster
4. **Future-Ready**: Prepared for integration with live water level data from gauge stations

### üöÄ **Future Enhancements**

This change sets up the foundation for:
- Live water level data integration from gauge stations
- Automatic flow condition assessment (Too Low, Optimal, Too High)
- Enhanced run recommendations based on current conditions
- Better data analytics and trends
