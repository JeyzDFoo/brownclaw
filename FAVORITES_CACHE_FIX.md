# Favorites Cache Fix

## Problem
After implementing the auto-loading of all runs on app startup, favorites weren't loading properly. The issue was in the `loadFavoriteRuns()` method.

## Root Cause
The `loadFavoriteRuns()` method was **clearing the entire cache** before loading favorites:

```dart
// ❌ WRONG - This was clearing all cached runs!
_cache.clear(); // Clear old entries
for (final run in favoriteRuns) {
  _cache[run.run.id] = run;
}
```

### What was happening:
1. **App starts** → `RiverRunProvider()` constructor calls `loadAllRuns()`
2. `loadAllRuns()` fetches ~127 runs from Firestore and caches them
3. **Favorites screen opens** → Calls `loadFavoriteRuns(favoriteIds)`
4. `loadFavoriteRuns()` clears the entire cache! ❌
5. Only the favorite runs get cached (e.g., 5 runs)
6. **"Find Runs" screen** has no cached data → Loads slowly

## Solution
Modified `loadFavoriteRuns()` to be cache-aware:

### 1. First, try to use the all-runs cache
```dart
// ✅ NEW - Check if we already have all runs loaded
if (_riverRuns.isNotEmpty && _isCacheValid) {
  // We already have all runs loaded, just filter for favorites
  final favoriteRuns = _riverRuns
      .where((run) => favoriteRunIds.contains(run.run.id))
      .toList();
  
  if (favoriteRuns.length == favoriteRunIds.length) {
    _favoriteRuns = favoriteRuns;
    notifyListeners();
    return; // ⚡ Instant! No Firestore call!
  }
}
```

### 2. Merge with cache instead of clearing
```dart
// ✅ NEW - Merge with existing cache, don't clear it!
for (final run in favoriteRuns) {
  _cache[run.run.id] = run;
}
```

## Benefits

### Before (Broken):
- ❌ All runs loaded → Cache populated with 127 runs
- ❌ Favorites loaded → Cache **cleared** and only 5 runs cached
- ❌ Find Runs screen slow (no cache)
- ❌ Wasted the initial load

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ All runs loaded → Cache populated with 127 runs
- ✅ Favorites instantly filtered from all-runs cache
- ✅ Find Runs screen instant (full cache)
- ✅ Maximum cache efficiency

## Cache Strategy

The provider now has a smart multi-level cache:

```
Level 1: Check _riverRuns (all runs already loaded?)
  ↓ MISS
Level 2: Check _cache (individual run cache)
  ↓ MISS
Level 3: Fetch from Firestore and MERGE with cache
```

### Cache Merge Logic:
- ✅ Preserves all runs from `loadAllRuns()`
- ✅ Adds/updates favorite runs if fetched
- ✅ Never clears existing cached data
- ✅ Maintains 10-minute cache timeout

## Performance Impact

### Typical Flow:
```
1. App starts
   ↓
2. RiverRunProvider loads all 127 runs (1 Firestore query)
   ↓
3. User opens Favorites tab
   ↓
4. Favorites filtered from _riverRuns cache (0 Firestore queries)
   ↓
5. User opens Find Runs tab
   ↓
6. All runs displayed from _riverRuns cache (0 Firestore queries)
```

**Total Firestore queries: 1** (down from 3+)

### Previous Flow (Broken):
```
1. App starts
   ↓
2. RiverRunProvider loads all 127 runs (1 Firestore query)
   ↓
3. User opens Favorites tab
   ↓
4. loadFavoriteRuns() CLEARS cache and loads 5 favorites (1 Firestore query)
   ↓
5. User opens Find Runs tab
   ↓
6. Screen loads 127 runs again (1 Firestore query)
```

**Total Firestore queries: 3** (and cache wasn't used properly)

## Debug Output

When favorites load successfully from cache:

```
⚡ CACHE HIT: Found all 5 favorites from all-runs cache
```

When favorites need to be fetched (rare):

```
🌊 Cache miss or expired, fetching favorite runs from Firestore...
💾 Updated cache with 5 favorite runs
```

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. ✅ App startup loads all runs
2. ✅ Favorites tab shows favorite runs instantly
3. ✅ Find Runs tab shows all runs instantly
4. ✅ No duplicate Firestore queries in debug logs
