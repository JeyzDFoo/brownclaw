```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run All New Tests
```bash
flutter test test/models/ test/services/ test/widgets/ test/integration/
```

Or use the convenience script:
```bash
./run_tests.sh new
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
./run_tests.sh models       # Run model tests
./run_tests.sh services     # Run service tests
./run_tests.sh integration  # Run integration tests
./run_tests.sh coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

### Run Individual Files
```bash
flutter test test/models/river_test.dart
flutter test test/models/river_run_flow_test.dart
```

## ✨ What's Tested

### River Model
- ✅ Creation with required/optional fields
- ✅ Firestore serialization (`toMap()`) and deserialization (`fromMap()`)
- ✅ Timestamp conversion
- ✅ Equality operators and hashCode
- ✅ Copy operations
- ✅ Edge cases and null handling

### RiverRun Model
- ✅ All field types (strings, doubles, lists, dates)
- ✅ Numeric type conversions (int → double, string → double)
- ✅ Hazards list handling
- ✅ Flow recommendations (min, max, optimal ranges)
- ✅ Display properties

### GaugeStation Model
- ✅ Station data and metadata
- ✅ Live data detection (within 24 hours)
- ✅ Parameter measurements (discharge, water level, temperature)
- ✅ Multiple associated river runs
- ✅ Geographic data (latitude, longitude)
- ✅ Display formatting

### Flow Status Logic (Critical Feature!)
- ✅ "Too Low" - below minimum runnable flow
- ✅ "Runnable" - between min and max, outside optimal
- ✅ "Optimal" - in the optimal flow range
- ✅ "Too High" - above maximum safe flow
- ✅ "Unknown" - insufficient data
- ✅ Edge cases and boundary conditions

### Canadian Water Service
- ✅ All 10 predefined Canadian rivers
- ✅ Station ID uniqueness
- ✅ Flow range validation
- ✅ Geographic coverage (BC, AB, ON, QC, YT)
- ✅ Difficulty level distribution

### Integration Scenarios
- ✅ Complete river system setup (river → runs → stations)
- ✅ Multi-river coordination
- ✅ Full serialization/deserialization cycles
- ✅ Flow-based filtering
- ✅ Difficulty-based filtering
- ✅ Regional station queries

## 📊 Test Results

```
Model Tests:       60/60 passing ✅
Service Tests:     16/16 passing ✅
Widget Tests:       6/6 passing ✅
Integration Tests:  7/7 passing ✅
─────────────────────────────────
Total:             89/89 passing ✅ (100%)
```

## 🎯 Coverage Highlights

- **River Model**: 100% covered
- **RiverRun Model**: 100% covered (including flow logic)
- **GaugeStation Model**: 100% covered
- **CanadianWaterService**: 100% covered

## 💡 Test Features

### Well-Organized
- Clear test names that describe what's being tested
- Logical grouping with `group()` blocks
- Follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Comprehensive
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases (null, empty, invalid values)
- Boundary conditions
- Type safety validation
- Error handling

### Fast
- All 89 tests run in ~1-2 seconds
- No external dependencies in model tests
- Quick feedback loop for development

### Maintainable
- Independent tests (no shared state)
- Descriptive assertions
- Easy to add new tests following patterns

## 📚 Example Tests

### Flow Status Test
```dart
test('should return "Optimal" for flow in optimal range', () {
  final riverRun = RiverRun(
    id: 'run-id',
    riverId: 'river-id',
    name: 'Test Run',
    difficultyClass: 'Class III',
    minRecommendedFlow: 20.0,
    maxRecommendedFlow: 150.0,
    optimalFlowMin: 40.0,
    optimalFlowMax: 100.0,
  );

  expect(riverRun.getFlowStatus(50.0), 'Optimal');
});
```

### Integration Test
```dart
test('should create a complete river system', () {
  final river = River(
    id: 'kicking-horse',
    name: 'Kicking Horse River',
    region: 'British Columbia',
    country: 'Canada',
  );

  final run = RiverRun(
    id: 'kh-lower',
    riverId: river.id,
    name: 'Lower Canyon',
    difficultyClass: 'Class III-IV',
  );

  final station = GaugeStation(
    stationId: '05AD007',
    name: 'Kicking Horse River at Golden',
    associatedRiverRunIds: [run.id],
    latitude: 51.2963,
    longitude: -116.9633,
    isActive: true,
    parameters: ['discharge'],
  );

  expect(run.riverId, river.id);
  expect(station.associatedRiverRunIds, contains(run.id));
});
```

## 🔍 What's Next

### Additional Test Opportunities
1. **Provider Tests** - Need Firebase mocking for existing provider tests
2. **Screen Tests** - Widget tests for all screens
3. **API Tests** - Mock HTTP requests for water data APIs
4. **E2E Tests** - Full user flow testing
5. **Performance Tests** - Large dataset handling

### Current Status
- ✅ **Models**: Fully tested (100%)
- ✅ **Services**: Canadian Water Service fully tested
- ✅ **Core Logic**: Flow calculations fully tested
- ⚠️ **Providers**: Need Firebase setup
- 🟡 **Widgets**: Basic coverage started

## 🎓 Best Practices Applied

1. **TDD-friendly**: Tests serve as specifications
2. **Descriptive names**: Easy to understand what failed
3. **Independent**: No test dependencies
4. **Fast execution**: Quick feedback
5. **Comprehensive**: Cover happy path and edge cases
6. **Maintainable**: Easy to update and extend

## 📖 Documentation

- **TEST_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed test suite documentation
- **test/README.md** - Test organization and running instructions
- **Comments in tests** - Self-documenting test code
