# Premium Paywall Implementation Summary

## Date: October 16, 2025

## Overview
Implemented a premium paywall system that restricts historical data chart views beyond 3 days to premium users only.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `PremiumProvider` (`lib/providers/premium_provider.dart`)
- New provider to manage premium subscription status
- Integrates with Firebase Firestore to store user premium status
- Methods:
  - `isPremium` - getter to check if user has premium
  - `checkPremiumStatus()` - fetches status from Firestore
  - `refreshPremiumStatus()` - manual refresh
  - `setPremiumStatus()` - for testing/admin purposes

### 2. Updated `providers.dart`
- Added export for `premium_provider.dart`
- Makes PremiumProvider available throughout the app

### 3. Updated `main.dart`
- Registered `PremiumProvider` with the MultiProvider
- Makes it available to all screens via Provider pattern

### 4. Updated `river_detail_screen.dart`
- Changed default chart view from 30 days to **3 days**
- Modified `_buildDayRangeSelector()` to use `Consumer<PremiumProvider>`
- Added lock icons to premium-only time ranges (7d, 30d, 365d)
- Disabled premium time ranges for free users with visual feedback
- Added `_showPremiumDialog()` method - shows premium upgrade prompt
- Added `_buildFeatureItem()` helper for feature list formatting
- Shows informational text: "🔒 Unlock 7, 30, and 365-day views with Premium"

### 5. Created `PremiumSettingsScreen` (`lib/screens/premium_settings_screen.dart`)
- New dedicated screen for managing premium subscription
- Shows current premium status with visual indicators
- Lists all premium features with lock/check icons
- Includes developer testing toggle to enable/disable premium
- "Upgrade to Premium" button (placeholder for future payment integration)

### 6. Updated `main_screen.dart`
- Added import for `premium_settings_screen.dart`
- Added "Premium Settings" menu item to AppBar popup menu
- Shows different icon based on premium status:
  - 🏆 Gold premium icon when active
  - 🔒 Lock icon when inactive
- Menu label changes: "Premium Active" vs "Premium Settings"

## User Experience

### Free Users
- Can view 3-day historical data charts (default view)
- See lock icons on 7d, 30d, and 365d options
- Clicking locked options shows premium upgrade dialog
- Clear messaging about premium features

### Premium Users
- Full access to all time ranges (3d, 7d, 30d, 365d)
- No lock icons or restrictions
- Gold premium icon in app menu

## Premium Features
1. 📊 7-day historical view
2. 📈 30-day historical view
3. 📉 Full year (365-day) view
4. 🎯 Advanced analytics (placeholder for future)

## Testing
Users can test premium functionality via:
1. Navigate to menu → "Premium Settings"
2. Use "Toggle Premium Status" switch (dev mode)
3. Status persists in Firestore under `users/{userId}/isPremium`

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Integrate actual payment processing (Stripe, RevenueCat, etc.)
- [ ] Add subscription management
- [ ] Add trial period functionality
- [ ] Add more premium features beyond chart ranges
- [ ] Email notifications for subscription status
- [ ] Analytics tracking for conversion metrics

## Database Schema
```
Firestore:
  users/
    {userId}/
      isPremium: boolean
```

## Notes
- Premium status is stored per-user in Firestore
- Default value is `false` (free account)
- Premium checks happen reactively via Provider pattern
- All historical data API calls still work - only UI is restricted
