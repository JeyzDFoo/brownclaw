# Subscription Cancellation Implementation

## Overview
Added user-facing subscription cancellation functionality to allow premium users to cancel their subscriptions directly from the app.

## Implementation Date
October 18, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Premium Settings Screen
**File**: `lib/screens/premium_settings_screen.dart`

**Changes**:
- Converted from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget` to handle async operations
- Added import for `StripeService`
- Added new "Manage Subscription" card that appears for premium users
- Implemented `_showCancelConfirmation()` method with confirmation dialog
- Added loading state during cancellation process

### 2. New Features

#### Subscription Management Card
- Appears only for premium users
- Clear explanation that premium features remain active until billing period ends
- "Cancel Subscription" button with red styling to indicate destructive action
- Loading state with spinner while processing cancellation

#### Confirmation Dialog
- Asks user to confirm before cancelling
- Two options:
  - "Keep Subscription" - dismisses dialog
  - "Cancel Subscription" - proceeds with cancellation
- Clear messaging about what happens after cancellation

#### Error Handling
- Try-catch block around cancellation logic
- Success message: "Subscription cancelled. Your premium access will continue until the end of your billing period."
- Error message displays specific error details
- Automatic premium status refresh after cancellation

## User Flow

1. User navigates to Premium Settings (from main menu)
2. If premium, sees "Manage Subscription" card
3. Clicks "Cancel Subscription" button
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. User confirms cancellation
6. Button shows loading spinner
7. Cloud Function called to cancel subscription
8. Stripe processes cancellation (subscription ends at period end)
9. Success message shown
10. Premium status refreshed

## Backend Flow

1. `StripeService().cancelSubscription()` called
2. Calls Cloud Function `cancelSubscription`
3. Cloud Function calls Stripe API: `stripe.Subscription.modify(subscription_id, cancel_at_period_end=True)`
4. Subscription marked to cancel at period end (user retains access until then)
5. Firestore updated with new subscription status
6. When period ends, Stripe webhook `customer.subscription.deleted` fires
7. Webhook sets `isPremium: false` in Firestore
8. App automatically reflects cancelled status

## Key Features

✅ **User-friendly cancellation** - No need to contact support or navigate to Stripe
✅ **Confirmation dialog** - Prevents accidental cancellations
✅ **Loading states** - Clear feedback during async operations
✅ **Error handling** - Graceful error messages if something goes wrong
✅ **Access preservation** - Users keep premium until period ends (fair to customer)
✅ **Automatic status sync** - Webhooks handle all backend updates

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test cancellation with active subscription
- [ ] Verify confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Check loading state displays correctly
- [ ] Confirm success message appears
- [ ] Verify premium access continues until period end
- [ ] Test error handling (disconnect from internet)
- [ ] Verify webhook updates status when period ends
- [ ] Check that "Cancel Subscription" button disappears after cancellation

## Notes

- Subscription cancellation is "soft" - cancels at period end, not immediately
- This is the industry standard and ensures customers get what they paid for
- Users can resubscribe at any time before or after period ends
- The developer testing toggle remains available for testing purposes
