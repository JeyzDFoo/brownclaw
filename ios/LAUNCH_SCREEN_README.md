## üé® Design Notes

The wave accent at the bottom creates a dynamic "water" feel that ties into the whitewater theme while remaining subtle and professional. The gradient provides depth and visual interest without being overwhelming.

The centered layout ensures the design works on all screen sizes, and the drop shadow on the title provides depth and readability against the brown background.
