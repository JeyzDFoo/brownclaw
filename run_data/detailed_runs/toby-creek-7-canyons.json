  "river_name": "Toby Creek",
  "section_name": "7 Canyons",
  "contributor": "Michael Reeder",
  "whats_it_like": "Beautiful class IV+ creeking that just keeps going and going! Easy access, minimal portaging, clean rapids and just enough spice to keep you focused.",
  "difficulty": {
    "text": "Mostly class IV/IV+ with one definite class V that can be portaged",
    "min": 4,
    "max": 5
  },
  "scouting_portaging": "Everything can be scouted and the only true class V can be portaged. One of the other biggest rapids on the run gets very tricky (maybe impossible) to portage at high water",
  "time": {
    "original": "Full day to show yourself down for the first time, half day if you know it."
  },
  "when_to_go": "Later in the summer as water levels come down. Usually a later July to early August run, but can come in at other times.",
  "flows_description": "Since there is no online gauge or stick gauge it is a little tricky to know when this river is in. If it looks well within its banks, clear and even a little bony in the flatter/wider parts that you can see from the road it is most likely in. If it looks really bony it probably is. If it looks fast and full then it is almost certainly too high. The level is easier to tell from the put in than the takeout since it is so wide and meandering at the takeout."
