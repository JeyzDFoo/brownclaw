  "flows_description": "Runnable flows in the fall, winter, and spring are fairly consistent by Island standards, fed by the large Cowichan Lake. As flows drop into the summer, a weir at the outlet of the lake retains enough water to release at very low levels. At the current summer base flow of ~7cms, the section is still technically runnable, but will very bony and overrun by inner tubers. A better low-medium flow is around 20-30cms. Unexpectedly, Marie Canyon is not a great high water run, and at flows around 100cms many rapids are washed out. 2020 hydrograph and median for COWICHAN RIVER AT LAKE COWICHAN (08HA002)."
