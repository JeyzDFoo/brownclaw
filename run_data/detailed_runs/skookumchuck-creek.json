  "flows_description": ": There is a painted rock gauge at the takeout. 1 is low, 3 is high. It can certainly be run higher, but does turn very fast and continuous with few eddies and shoreline trees become a real hazard. Typically this river runs at good flows in early to mid summer, after the spring flood."
