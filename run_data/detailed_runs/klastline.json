Remote and with only a handful of descents the Klastline is a good option for anyone who plans to be in the area and wants to run something other than the Stikine. Some class 4 bedrock rapids, 2 big waterfalls (one that has yet to be run) and some steep boulder gardens make for varied if not \"ultra-classic\" whitewater.",
